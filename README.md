## Repository Purpose & Scope

This repository contains the code, selected processed data, and scriptable workflow to reproduce the analyses and figures in the manuscript.
Because the study uses **topic modelling** on a corpus of 943 articles (full text), only derived data (e.g. term–document matrices, cleaned text, topic assignments) are included here — not the PDF article files which are under copyright.

The goal is that anyone with access to the same corpus (or a suitably similar one) can rerun, inspect, and extend the methodological steps.

The root has all the code for the analysis in a single file (supplement_A2_all_code_for_Degrowth_and_Postgrowth_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Growth_Critical_Science),
with the processed data in data/public/
All code is available also in single scripts in code_in_separate_files/.
